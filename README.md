AntiSpam
==========

A quick series of examples on how to determine if a sentence/ post is spam
(spam being defined as containing undesired words, duplicate content from other
posts, etc.).

Twitch?
=======

Yeah, they have a programming section and everything, so I figured I'd lend
some knowledge to programming broadcasts that take the form of a video
tutorial. In the broadcasts I go through what I am creating, why I am making
the decisions I am (and programming the items in a given way) as well as some
of the common pit falls that people just starting out run in to.

If you are interested in viewing a broadcast at some point, feel free to drop
